### 1. Docstrings for Functions



### 2. Handling Edge Cases

**`optimize_relationships`**

- **Input Validation**: Ensures that the `relationships` and `initial_positions` are valid dictionaries, and that relationship weights are between -10 and 10.
- **Position Normalization**: Prevents positions from exceeding the 10x10 area by checking the maximum distance and proportionally scaling all node positions.
- **Termination Condition**: Uses the `end_check()` function to ensure all friends are within 4 units and all enemies are at least 1 unit apart.
- **Iteration Limit**: Sets a counter `count` to control the number of iterations and decreases the temperature `t` to ensure the algorithm terminates within a reasonable time.
- **Zero Division Prevention**: Checks if the vector length is zero during normalization to prevent division by zero errors.

### 3. Implementing Constraints

**`optimize_relationships`**

- **Relationship Distance Constraints**: Ensures through each iteration that friends are within 4 units and enemies are at least 1 unit apart by calculating and updating the distances between nodes.
- **Fixed Node Position**: Ensures the position of node A is fixed at (0,0) during each position update.
- **Position Limitation**: Uses maximum distance checks and proportional scaling to ensure all node positions remain within the 10x10 area.
- **Drawing and Visualization**: Provides drawing and process visualization capabilities through `draw` and `show_process` parameters, allowing for observation of the algorithm's process and final results.

# 任务4
### 1. Docstrings for Functions



### 2. Handling Edge Cases

**`detect_communities`**

- **Self-Relationship**: Ignores self-relationships by continuing the loop when `i == j`.
- **Distance and Relationship Calculation**: Ensures calculations handle missing relationship entries by using try-except blocks.
- **Non-Core Points**: Removes non-core points (nodes with fewer than `m` neighbors within the threshold distance) to ensure meaningful clusters.
- **Duplicate Removal**: Uses `dict.fromkeys()` to remove duplicate nodes when merging clusters.
- **Clustering Termination**: Uses a `merged` flag to break out of the loop when no further merging is possible, ensuring the algorithm terminates correctly.
- **Unclustered Nodes**: Identifies and handles nodes that do not belong to any cluster for visualization purposes.

### 3. Implementing Constraints

**`detect_communities`**

- **Custom Distance Calculation**: Combines spatial and relational data to compute a custom distance metric for clustering. The metric is calculated using an exponential function to normalize distances and relationship strengths.
- **Core Points Identification**: Identifies core points as nodes with at least `m` neighbors within a threshold distance, ensuring that clusters are formed around densely connected regions.
- **Cluster Merging**: Merges clusters that have intersecting members, ensuring clusters are not overly fragmented and are meaningful.
- **Cluster Representation**: Transforms the cluster dictionary to a format where each key is a cluster identifier and the value is a list of nodes in that cluster.
- **Visualization**: Provides an optional visualization of the clustering result using matplotlib, displaying spatial positions and color-coding different clusters.
